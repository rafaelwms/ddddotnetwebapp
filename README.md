## Description:
This repository demonstrates a sample .NET Web API application built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. The project showcases the implementation of DDD concepts such as entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, and application services to create a well-structured and maintainable application.

## Key Features:
Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Implements DDD principles to separate business logic from technical concerns, leading to a more modular and flexible design.
Clean Architecture: Adheres to the Clean Architecture principles to ensure clear separation of concerns and testability.
RESTful API: Exposes a RESTful API for consuming and managing domain resources.
Entity Framework Core: Utilizes Entity Framework Core for data persistence and data access.
Unit Tests and Integration Tests: Provides comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Target Audience:
This project is intended for developers interested in learning and applying DDD principles to .NET Web API development. It also serves as a reference for creating maintainable and scalable web applications using DDD.

## Getting Started:
Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies using the package manager (e.g., NuGet).
Run the Application: Run the application using the provided startup script (e.g., dotnet run).
Explore the Code: Explore the codebase to understand the implementation of DDD concepts and the overall application architecture.

## Additional Notes:
This is a sample project for learning purposes. It may not represent a production-ready application.
